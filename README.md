# **Examples for svFSI**

This repository contains examples for using and testing `svFSI`. Examples are organized based on the physics solved. Each example folder has multiple cases with several options that include boundary conditions, linear solver settings, etc. User are encouraged to review [`svFSI_master.inp`](./svFSI_master.inp) for a detailed description of the input file and its settings.

A description of each example will be provided soon. Examples include:

(1) heat: diffusion equation solver

(2) lelas: linear elasticity

(3) stokes: simulates Stokes flow

(4) fluid: incompressible flow (Navier-Stokes equation)

(5) struct: nonlinear displacement-based solid mechanics

(6) ustruct: nonlinear velocity-pressure based solid mechanics

(7) fsi: fluid-structure interaction (ALE, CMM)

(8) cep: cardiac electrophysiology modeling
